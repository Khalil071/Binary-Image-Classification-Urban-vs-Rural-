Binary Image Classification (Urban vs Rural)
This project classifies binary images into two categories: urban and rural. The task is to distinguish between urban and rural scenes based on image features. This README includes two approaches: one using transfer learning and the other without.

Approach 1: Classification with Transfer Learning
In this approach, a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on the urban-rural dataset to leverage previously learned features for faster and more accurate classification.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset consists of images labeled as either "urban" or "rural," representing scenes from cities and countryside areas.
Model: The project uses transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) to perform binary classification.
Purpose: The goal is to classify images into urban and rural categories, leveraging the power of transfer learning to improve the model's efficiency and accuracy.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (with Keras)
Numpy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
OpenCV (for image processing)

Model Architecture
Pre-trained CNN Model: A pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet is used as the base model. The base model is frozen initially to preserve the learned features.
Custom Fully Connected Layers: After the base model, a few fully connected (Dense) layers are added to adapt the model for the urban-rural binary classification task.
Output Layer: The final layer is a Dense layer with a sigmoid activation function to predict whether the image is urban or rural.
Example Usage
python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, GlobalAveragePooling2D
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Load the pre-trained VGG16 model
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the layers of the base model
base_model.trainable = False

# Create the model with additional layers
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output: 1 for binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)
Results
After training the model, evaluate its performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. You can also plot the training and validation loss/accuracy curves.

Approach 2: Classification Without Transfer Learning
In this approach, a CNN is built from scratch for the urban-rural classification task, without relying on pre-trained models.

Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset contains binary images labeled as "urban" or "rural."
Model: A simple CNN model is constructed to directly classify the images into urban or rural categories.
Purpose: This approach builds the model entirely from scratch, learning features specific to the urban-rural classification task.
Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations to extract relevant features from the images.
Pooling Layers: Max-pooling layers to reduce the spatial dimensions and retain important features.
Fully Connected Layers: A few dense layers to output the final prediction.
Output Layer: A final Dense layer with a sigmoid activation to classify the image as urban or rural.
Example Usage

from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam

# Build a CNN model from scratch
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')  # Output: 1 for binary classification
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)
Results
After training the CNN, evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score). Plot the training and validation loss/accuracy over the epochs to visualize the model's learning process.
